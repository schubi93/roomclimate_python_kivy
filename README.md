# logfile_analysis_for_random_experiment

A project for a rasperry pi, written in python to display different room climate and showing a wet, sweating or freezing smiley..

## Ideas

This program was written to help a friend of mine with a moaning girlfriend. She was always complaining about a too hot or too cold flat.
